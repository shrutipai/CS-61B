You must answer at least 4 questions, but the remaining ones are optional. The main goal of this file is to get you thinking critically about your own work, but we will also use these self reflections at the end of the semester when we do our internal review of the course.

ArrayDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: 

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A: I felt proud that I was able to identify bugs and fix them using my own randomized testing, rather than using a staff autograder.

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A:

Q: What did you learn by talking to your partner about writing ArrayDeque?

A:

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing ArrayDeque, if anything?

A:

Q: If you wrote ArrayDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

LinkedListDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: 

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A: Throughout my coding career I was never focusing on elegance or style because I was purely focused on problem
solving, but with this project I was proud of how clean and readable my final code was.

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A: My equals() methods were identical in both ArrayDeque and LinkedListDeque, so I think a more efficient way of doing
that would be to add equals() as a default method to the Deque() interface.

Q: What did you learn by talking to your partner about writing LinkedListDeque?

A:

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing LinkedListDeque, if anything?

A: I wish I started off by using the java visualizer or drawing out my ideas visually, because I did not realize
how much I did not understand how to manipulate the node pointers until I submitted my project for the first time
and failed almost every autograder test.

Q: If you wrote LinkedListDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

A:

Q: Did you like this design review process? Anything we should do differently next time?
